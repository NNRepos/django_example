1. If you get the "NoReverseMatch" error, it may point at the wrong file (probably a bug in the implementation of django 1.11).
    The probable cause is a misuse of a django template, e.g. {% url reference.causing.error %}
2. The bootstrap cdn css links(copied from https://getbootstrap.com/) did not work for me. I've use the maxCDN files.
3. It seems like the registration-redux makes some things harder to do, such as redirecting after filling the logout form.
4. The django templating language does not understand html comments, if you want to comment it out you'll have to delete the curly braces.
