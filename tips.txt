1. If you get the "NoReverseMatch" error, it may point at the wrong file (probably a bug in the implementation of django 1.11).
    The probable cause is a misuse of a django template, e.g. {% url reference.causing.error %}
2. The bootstrap cdn css links(copied from https://getbootstrap.com/) did not work for me. I've use the maxCDN files.
